# TibetSwap Security

Security is a priority for TibetSwap. There is an ongoing bug bounty program that covers all issues that could endanger funds in the protocol. Payouts are decided on a case-by-case basis, and the funds for the program are held at [xch1yej80zwys9m2kkpch0ywltflxtdyprm2qfd0adwm8ur6qhhnex3qj0sknl](https://www.spacescan.io/address/xch1yej80zwys9m2kkpch0ywltflxtdyprm2qfd0adwm8ur6qhhnex3qj0sknl) ([TibetSwap.xch](https://tibetswap.xch.cx/)).

## Understanding the Code

Reading chialisp is not easy, and TibetSwap is powered by multiple puzzles that interact in complex ways. With that in mind, you can use the following resources to get a basic understanding of what's going on, which you can then use to hunt for bugs.
